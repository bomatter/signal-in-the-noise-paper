"""
Interface for user configurations.

Reads configurations from a YAML file, which may be located in the following locations (in order of precedence):
1. Path specified by the 'SITN_USER_CONFIG' environment variable.
2. `user_config.yaml` file in the current working directory.
3. `user_config.yaml` file in the repository root (two levels up from this file).

Returns a dictionary with the loaded configurations.

Example usage:
    from sitn.user_config import user_config
    print(user_config)
